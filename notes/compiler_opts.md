title: "Required compiler options"
---

Unless otherwise noted in a specific assignment, all of your C/C++ source should compile cleanly when compiled with the options:

C programs (compiled with `gcc`):

> `-g -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra`

C++ programs (compiled with `g++`):

> `-g -std='c++11' -pedantic -Wall -Wextra`
