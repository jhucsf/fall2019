title: "Late Days Policy"
---

Over the course of the semester, you may use up to 5 late days for homework submissions.  A late day is defined as the 24 hour period after a submission deadline.  <strike>Note that there is a 5% grade overall deduction for each late day you use on a homework.</strike>

Important restrictions:

* If you feel that you need to use *more* than two late days on an assignment, you *must* notify the course staff by sending a private note to the instructors on Piazza
* Any late days you (attempt to) use after the 5 late days you are given for the semester result in a grade of 0 for the assignment (if there are truly exceptional circumstances, send a private note to the instructors on Piazza explaining the situation)

Note that as a special case, [Homework 1](../hw/hw1.html) may be submitted 48 hours past the deadline without a grade penalty and without requiring you to use late days.
