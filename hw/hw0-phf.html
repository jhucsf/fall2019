<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This assignment is mostly a warmup exercise giving you a chance to review your
C programming skills.
You’ll also learn something useful about what’s <em>actually</em> in a file which will
come in <em>very</em> handy for future assignments.
The program is also <em>easy</em> to test because you can use <em>existing UNIX tools</em> to
compare your output against; so test a lot!
<strong>If you have trouble with this assignment, you’ll likely have even more
trouble with future assignments.</strong></p>

<h2>Problem 1: Hexdumps (100%)</h2>

<p>Start by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump">reading up</a> on what hexdumps
are.
For this problem, you will write a program <code>hex.c</code> that produces a hexdump on
standard output for data read from standard input.
Let’s start with an example:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./hex
Hello
00000000: 48 65 6c 6c 6f 0a                                Hello.
</code></pre>

<p>The program was started, then the user typed the word “Hello” followed by
return/enter, then CTRL-D was used to stop the input.
The result shows the <em>ASCII code</em> for each character (in <em>hexadecimal</em>, so it’s
guaranteed to be two digits wide for each character), including the newline
character generated by the return/enter key.
The formatting may look a bit strange, but the purpose of the “large gap”
becomes apparent if we examine a longer input:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./hex
This is a longer example of a hexdump. Marvel at its magnificence.
00000000: 54 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 61 20 6c 6f 6e 67 65 72  This is a longer
00000010: 20 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 20 6f 66 20 61 20 68 65   example of a he
00000020: 78 64 75 6d 70 2e 20 4d 61 72 76 65 6c 20 61 74  xdump. Marvel at
00000030: 20 69 74 73 20 6d 61 67 6e 69 66 69 63 65 6e 63   its magnificenc
00000040: 65 2e 0a                                         e..
</code></pre>

<p>This time the user entered two sentences, then signaled end of input with
CTRL-D.
Again, we see the ASCII code for each character (including spaces and
newlines).
The formatting is set up so that regardless of the number of characters, we
always have three “columns” of output:</p>

<ol>
<li>First the overall “position” in the input. Note that this is also a
hexadecimal number, <strong>formatted to 8 digits</strong>.</li>
<li>Then the ASCII values for each character in hexadecimal, at most 16
to a line.</li>
<li>Finally a string-like representation of the data, with printable characters
shown but non-printable characters (like newline or tab) replaced with a
dot.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that there’s a single space between the colon after the offset and the
ASCII values, but there are <em>two</em> spaces between the ASCII values and the
string-like representation.</p>

<p>On Piazza you’ll find some starter code for this program.
You can of course ignore the starter code and write the entire thing from
scratch yourself, but we recommend you use the starter code:
It contains a few important hints that you may not want to live without.
Good luck!</p>

<h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can use the existing <code>xxd</code> program to check your output against.
Running <code>xxd -g 1</code> and then typing into that should produce the same
output as your <code>hex.c</code> program.</li>
<li>Try to find a function that allows you to check whether a character
is “printable” or not. Don’t try to decide that question yourself!</li>
<li>You’ll need a small, fixed-size array for this problem, but the
details are already laid out for you in the starter code.</li>
<li>Remember to break up your code into smaller chunks using helper
functions!</li>
<li>One purpose of hexdumps is to examine <strong>binary</strong> files. You can try
this with your <code>hex</code> program itself: <code>./hex &lt;hex</code> will show you lots
of interesting bits that you may not expect.</li>
<li>(We use “character” above when we maybe should say “byte” instead
because these days encodings such as Unicode interpret “character”
differently. Alas, in C, the <code>char</code> type is virtually identical to
“byte” so it’s probably close enough to use “character” this way;
at least in the context of a hexdump program.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>Please follow the submission instructions as detailed on
<a href="http://piazza.com/jhu/fall2018/600229">Piazza</a>.
Be sure to include a <code>Makefile</code> that sets the appropriate compiler flags and
builds the <code>hex</code> program by default.
<strong>Finally, make sure to include your name and email address in <em>every</em> file
you turn in (well, in every file for which it makes sense to do so anyway)!</strong></p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>For reference, here is a short explanation of the grading criteria;
some of the criteria don’t apply to all problems,
and not all of the criteria are used on all assignments.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong> refers to the proper organization of the stuff you hand in,
following both the guidelines for Deliverables above as well as the general
submission instructions for assignments on <a href="http://piazza.com/jhu/fall2018/600229">Piazza</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Style</strong> refers to C programming style, including things like consistent
indentation, appropriate identifier names, useful comments, suitable
documentation, etc.
Simple, clean, readable code is what you should be aiming for.
Make sure you follow the style guide posted on <a href="http://piazza.com/jhu/fall2018/600229">Piazza</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong> refers to proper modularization (functions, modules, etc.) and
an appropriate choice of algorithms and data structures.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong> refers to how fast/with how little memory your programs can
produce the required results compared to other submissions.</p>

<p><strong>Functionality</strong> refers to your programs being able to do what they
should according to the specification given above; if the specification
is ambiguous, ask for clarification!
(It also refers to you simply doing the required work, which may not be
programming alone.)</p>

<p><strong>If your programs cannot be built you will get no points whatsoever.
If your programs cannot be built without warnings using the required compiler
options given on <a href="http://piazza.com/jhu/fall2018/600229">Piazza</a> we will take off 10% (except if you
document a <em>very</em> good reason).
If your programs cannot be built using <code>make</code> we will take off 10%.
If <code>valgrind</code> detects memory errors in your programs, we will take off 10%.
If your programs fail miserably even once, i.e. terminate with an exception of
any kind or dump core, we will take off 10% (for each such case).</strong></p>
