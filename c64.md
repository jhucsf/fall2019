This page has some information about the 6502 and the Commodore 64, including information to help you write and test 6502 code using a C64 emulator.

**VICE (Commodore emulator)**:

VICE is a software emulator for a variety of [Commodore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_International) computers including the C64.  The C64 emulator program provided by VICE is named **x64**.

* [VICE website](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/): main website, Windows binaries
* [Building VICE 3.3 on Linux](https://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/building-vice-on-linux.html): instructions for building VICE on Linux systems, worked for me on Linux Mint 19.1 (which based on Ubuntu 18.04), should work on other distros
* [SMON information page](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SMON), [SMON download page](http://www.cbmhardware.de/dlmanager/index.php?id=162)

SMON is a simple but useful monitor program that allows you to

* Inspect and modify memory
* Write assembly language code
* Disassemble memory into assembly language instructions

The SMON download is a C64 disk image: attach it as Drive 8 in VICE (File→Attach disk image→Drive \#8), load from BASIC with

> `LOAD"SMONFC000",8,1`

and then execute from BASIC with

> `SYS 49152`
